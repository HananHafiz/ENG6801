## ENG 6801 version control project
This is a collaborative project for practicing version control for the Spring 2020 UCF ENG 6801 course. 
You will be creating a collaborative syllabus for ENG 6800: Introduction to Texts and Technology.
Instructions for the assignment can be found on our Webcourses site.

The IntroToT&TSyllabus.md file is the syllabus skeleton that you will be editing.

# Hack Section or Digital Assignments:
In order to improve the student digital skills and as part of T&T core technology sequence 20% of the course grade will be dedicated to two technical assignments:
 
### 1- Mind Map Assignment (5 points):
As a preparation for the final paper students will be working on developing the paper ideas, methods and hypothesis using Mind Map: **https://www.xmind.net/**
The map should include the paper topic, research method, research questions and hypothesis, the sample, the audience you think might be interested in this topic, and potential journal or conference to Publish.

### 2- T&T Conferences Collection Website (15 points): 
Through the semester students will be introduced to many conferences in this course and in other courses and email announcements. In this assignment using simple HTML students will help in building a collaborative library that includes many conferences that will be published and shared with all T&T students and faculty. Each student is required to bring only 3 conferences from their choice then add them under the T&T track that will be more relevant to these conferences. The website has a template has a separate page for each track:
* Digital Humanities
* Digital Media
* Editing, Publishing
* Interdisciplinary Curating (EPIC)
* Public History
* Rhetoric and Composition
* Scientific and Technical Communication
for each conference the student is required to write the conference type, date, place, submission requirement, overall summary of its activities, and finally link to the conference website if possible. After the end of the semester students are encouraged to keep editing this website since it will be a very useful conference source to all T&T departments.
